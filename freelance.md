# Hire Me

**What I bring to the table**

I have a career as a professional software developer which spans over 10 years. I have spent a lot of this time working on small teams or as the sole developer building new applications from the ground up in industries such as Finance, Human Resouces, Warehousing and more.

I can take software projects from conception to final delivery. At all times I am honest with clients about my abilities, and my  experience allow me to make decisions which are in the best interest of the project.

I have over three years experience in working either as a remote employee, or remotely as a freelancer which allows me to work independently, yet ensure that status of the project and related tasks are communicated clearly to all stakeholders at all times.

I am comfortable working across the entire stack for web applications.

I have a lot of experience working with authentication and authorization (specifically technologies such as OAuth and JWT), as I have been responsible for the development and maintenance of all the .NET SDKs, sample applications and tutorials.

I blog on this website about .NET related topics and also curate ASP.NET Weekly, which is a weekly digest of all the best ASP.NET related news and blog posts. This blog gives me a great high-level awareness of the current state-of-the-art in software development, as well as the tools and technologies that are available to support the software development life cycle.
